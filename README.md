# Job-Scheduling
Algorithm that uses a Brute-Force method. Given a sequence of n weeks, the manager must come up with a plan of action with the options: low-stress, high-stress, or rest resulting in the optimum sequence to bring in the most revenue. The problem: Given sets of values l1, l2,....ln and h1, h2,....,hn, find a plan of maximum value (revenue). (Such a plan will be called optimal).

Brute Force (O(3n))
